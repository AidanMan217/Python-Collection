These are small personal projects I'm working while I study pure mathematics to learn the basics of Python.

Projects:

1. Double Integration Calculator
   - I started this in November 2022 as a Lua project in ROBLOX because it was the only language I knew at the time. I started with the basic definition of Riemann sums and expanded it to double integration.
     I can expand it further, but it eventually gets too slow especially if you allow more rectangles (partitions). I then rewrote it in Python which was very similar.

2. Math 134: Nonlinear Dynamics Homework
   - Every homework in the class "Linear and Nonlinear Systems of Differential Equations" or as my professor called it "Linear and Nonlinear Dynamics", there was a lot of graphing work in python
     and I had to struggle to try and learn Numpy and Matplotlib. However, the visualization of different phase plots are beautiful. I have a lot more, but I didn't save each notebook because it was tedious.
     I only saved the notebooks for the bigger problems.

3. Math 164: Optimization
   - Every optimization I am coding for this class is done willingly and not as homework. Coding these algorithms helps me learn python and techniques that will be used for machine learning. I have heard that some of these algorithms are very useful. The algorithms I will be coding are: Golden Section Search,  Fibonacci Method, Newton's Method, Steepest Descent, and others that I will be learning throughout the class. 

4. Project Euler Problems
   - These are problems I have selected from projecteuler.net. Project Euler is a website that contains a collection of challenging mathematical problems that require a computer to solve. Problems can be solved using any language, and in this case I am using python.

5. Math 156: Machine Learning
   - There is soon to be a group project for this class based on Convolutional Neural Networks. The project will be uploaded here when it's done. Group sizes are between 2-4 people.
